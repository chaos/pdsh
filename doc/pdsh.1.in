.SH NAME
pdsh \- issue commands to groups of hosts in parallel

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpdsh\fR [\fIoptions\fR]... command

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpdsh\fR is a variant of the rsh(1) command. Unlike rsh(1), which runs
commands on a single remote host, \fBpdsh\fR can run multiple remote commands
in parallel. \fBpdsh\fR uses a "sliding window" (or \fIfanout\fR) of threads
to conserve resources on the initiating host while allowing some 
connections to time out. 
.LP
When \fBpdsh\fR receives SIGINT (ctrl-C), it lists the status of current 
threads. A second SIGINT within one second terminates the program. Pending
threads may be canceled by issuing ctrl-Z within one second of ctrl-C.
Pending threads are those that have not yet been initiated, or are still
in the process of connecting to the remote host.

.LP
If a remote command is not specified on the command line, \fBpdsh\fR
runs interactively, prompting for commands and executing them when
terminated with a carriage return. In interactive mode, target nodes
that time out on the first command are not contacted for subsequent
commands, and commands prefixed with an exclamation point will be 
executed on the local system.
.LP
The core functionality of \fBpdsh\fR may be supplemented by dynamically
loadable modules. The modules may provide a new connection protocol
(replacing the standard rcmd(3) protocol used by rsh(1)), filtering
options (e.g. removing hosts that are "down" from the target list),
and/or host selection options (e.g., \fI\-a\fR selects all hosts from
a configuration file.). By default, \fBpdsh\fR must have at least
one "rcmd" module loaded. See the \fBRCMD MODULES\fR section for more 
information.

.SH "RCMD MODULES"
The method by which \fBpdsh\fR runs commands on remote hosts may be
selected at runtime using the \fI-R\fR option (See \fIOPTIONS\fR below).
This functionality is ultimately implemented via dynamically loadable
modules, and so the list of available options may be different
from installation to installation. A list of currently available rcmd 
modules is printed when using any of the \fI-h\fR, \fI-V\fR, or \fI-L\fR 
options. The default rcmd module will also be displayed with the
\fI-h\fR and \fI-V\fR options.
.LP
A list of \fIrcmd\fR modules currently distributed with \fBpdsh\fR 
follows.
.TP 8
rsh
Uses an internal, thread-safe implementation of BSD rcmd(3)
to run commands using the standard rsh(1) protocol.
.TP
exec
Executes an arbitrary command for each target host. The first
of the \fBpdsh\fR remote arguments is the local command
to execute, followed by any further arguments. Some simple
parameters are substitued on the command line, including
\fI%h\fR for the target hostname, \fI%u\fR for the remote
username, and \fI%n\fR for the remote rank [0-n] (To get
a literal \fI%\fR use \fI%%\fR).  For example,
the following would duplicate using the \fBssh\fR module to
run \fBhostname\fR(1) across the hosts foo[0-10]:

.nf
   pdsh -R exec -w foo[0-10] ssh -x -l %u %h hostname
.fi

and this command line would run \fBgrep\fR(1) in parallel 
across the files console.foo[0-10]:

.nf
   pdsh -R exec -w foo[0-10] grep BUG console.%h
.fi

.TP
ssh
Uses a variant of popen(3) to run multiple copies of the ssh(1)
command.
.TP
mrsh
This module uses the mrsh(1) protocol to execute jobs on remote hosts.
The mrsh protocol uses a credential based authentication, forgoing
the need to allocate reserved ports. In other aspects, it acts just
like rsh. Remote nodes must be running mrshd(8) in order for the mrsh
module to work.
.TP
qsh
Allows \fBpdsh\fR to execute MPI jobs over QsNet. Qshell propagates
the current working directory, pdsh environment, and Elan capabilities
to the remote process. The following environment variable are also
appended to the environment: RMS_RANK, RMS_NODEID, RMS_PROCID, RMS_NNODES,
and RMS_NPROCS. Since \fBpdsh\fR needs to run setuid root for qshell
support, qshell does not directly support propagation of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and LD_PREOPEN. Instead the QSHELL_REMOTE_LD_LIBRARY_PATH and 
QSHELL_REMOTE_LD_PREOPEN environment variables will may be used and will
be remapped to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_PREOPEN by the qshell daemon if set.
.TP
mqsh
Similar to qshell, but uses the mrsh protocol instead of the rsh protocol.
.TP
krb4
The krb4 module allows users to execute remote commands after 
authenticating with kerberos. Of course, the remote rshd daemons
must be kerberized.
.TP
xcpu
The xcpu module uses the xcpu service to execute remote commands.

.SH OPTIONS
The list of available options is determined at runtime
by supplementing the list of standard \fBpdsh\fR options with
any options provided by loaded \fIrcmd\fR and \fImisc\fR modules.
In some cases, options provided by modules may conflict with
each other. In these cases, the modules are incompatible and
the first module loaded wins.

.SH "Standard target nodelist options"
.TP
.I "-w [rcmd_type:][user@]host,host,..."
Target the specified list of hosts. Do not use with any other
node selection options (e.g. \fI\-a\fR, \fI\-g\fR if they are
available). No spaces are allowed in the comma-separated list.
A list consisting of a single `-' character causes the target
hosts to be read from stdin, one per line. The host list may 
contain hostlist expressions of the form ``host[1-5,7]''. For
more information about the hostlist format, see the 
\fBHOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS\fR section below. A list of hosts
may also be preceded by "user@" to specify a remote username
other than the default, or "rcmd_type:" to specify an alternate
rcmd connection type for these hosts. When used together,
the rcmd type must be specified first, e.g. "ssh:user1@host0"
would use ssh to connect to host0 as user "user1."
.TP
.I "-x host,host,..."
Exclude the specified hosts. May be specified in conjunction with
other target node list options such as \fI\-a\fR and \fI\-g\fR (when
available). Hostlists may also be specified to the \fI\-x\fR option
(see the \fBHOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS\fR section below).

.SH "Standard pdsh options"
.TP 
.I "-S"
Return the largest of the remote command return values.
.TP
.I "-h"
Output usage menu and quit. A list of available rcmd modules
will also be printed at the end of the usage message.
.TP
.I "-s"
Only on AIX, separate remote command stderr and stdout into two sockets.
.TP
.I "-q"
List option values and the target nodelist and exit without action.
.TP
.I "-b"
Disable ctrl-C status feature so that a single ctrl-C kills parallel
job. (Batch Mode)
.TP
.I "-l user"
This option may be used to run remote commands as another user, subject to
authorization. For BSD rcmd, this means the invoking user and system must
be listed in the user\'s .rhosts file (even for root).
.TP
.I "-t seconds"
Set the connect timeout. Default is @CONNECT_TIMEOUT@ seconds.
.TP
.I "-u seconds"
Set a limit on the amount of time a remote command is allowed to execute.
Default is no limit. See note in LIMITATIONS if using \fI-u\fR with ssh.
.TP
.I "-f number"
Set the maximum number of simultaneous remote commands to \fInumber\fR.
The default is @FANOUT@. 
.TP
.I "-R name"
Set rcmd module to \fIname\fR. This option may also be set via the
PDSH_RCMD_TYPE environment variable. A list of available rcmd
modules may be obtained via the \fI-h\fR, \fI-V\fR, or \fI-L\fR options. 
The default will be listed with \fI-h\fR or \fI-V\fI.
.TP
.I "-M name,..."
When multiple \fBmisc\fR modules provide the same options to \fBpdsh\fR,
the first module initialized "wins" and subsequent modules are not loaded.
The \fI-M\fR option allows a list of modules to be specified that will be
force-initialized before all others, in-effect ensuring that they load
without conflict (unless they conflict with eachother). This option may
also be set via the PDSH_MISC_MODULES environment variable.
.TP
.I "-L"
List info on all loaded \fBpdsh\fR modules and quit.
.TP
.I "-N"
Disable hostname: prefix on lines of output.
.TP
.I "-d"
Include more complete thread status when SIGINT is received, and display
connect and command time statistics on stderr when done.
.TP
.I "-V"
Output \fBpdsh\fR version information, along with list of currently
loaded modules, and exit.

.SH "qsh/mqsh module options"
.TP
.I "-n tasks_per_node"
Set the number of tasks spawned per node. Default is 1.
.TP
.I "-m block | cyclic"
Set block versus cyclic allocation of processes to nodes. Default is
block. 
.TP
.I "-r railmask"
Set the rail bitmask for a job on a multirail system. The default 
railmask is 1, which corresponds to rail 0 only. Each bit set in 
the argument to \fI-r\fR corresponds to a rail on the system, so
a value of 2 would correspond to rail 1 only, and 3 would indicate
to use both rail 1 and rail 0.

.SH "machines module options"
.TP
.I "-a"
Target all nodes from machines file.

.SH "genders module options"
.LP
In addition to the genders options presented below, the genders 
attribute pdsh_rcmd_type may also be used in the genders database
to specify an alternate rcmd connect type than the pdsh default
for hosts with this attribute. For example, the following line
in the genders file
.nf

  host0 pdsh_rcmd_type=ssh

.fi
would cause \fBpdsh\fR to use ssh to connect to host0, even if rsh were 
the default.  This can be overridden on the commandline with the 
"rcmd_type:host0" syntax.

.TP 
.I "-A"
Target all nodes in genders database. The \fI-A\fR option will target
every host listed in genders -- if you want to omit some hosts by default,
see the \fI-a\fR option below.
.TP
.I "-a"
Target all nodes in genders database except those with the "pdsh_all_skip"
attribute. This is shorthand for running "pdsh -A -X pdsh_all_skip ..."
.TP 
.I "-g attr[=val][,attr[=val],...]"
Target nodes that match any of the specified genders attributes (with
optional values). Conflicts with \fI\-a\fR and \fI\-w\fR options. This
option targets the alternate hostnames in the genders database by
default. The \fI\-i\fR option provided by the genders module may be used
to translate these to the canonical genders hostnames. If the installed
version of genders supports it, attributes supplied to \fI-g\fR may also
take the form of genders \fBqueries\fR. Genders \fBqueries\fR will query
the genders database for the union, intersection, difference, or complement
of genders attributes and values.  The set operation union is represented
by two pipe symbols ('||'), intersection by two ampersand symbols ('&&'),
difference by two minus symbols ('--'), and complement by a tilde ('~').
Parentheses may be used to change the order of operations. See the
nodeattr(1) manpage for examples of genders \fBqueries\fR.
.TP
.I "-X attr[=val][,attr[=val],...]"
Exclude nodes that match any of the specified genders attributes
(optionally with values).  This option may be used in combination with any
other of the node selection options (e.g. \fI-w\fR, \fI-g\fR, \fI-a\fR,
...). If the installed version of genders supports it, arguments to
\fI-X\fR may also take the form of genders \fBqueries\fR. Please see
documentation for the genders \fI-g\fR option for more information about
genders \fBqueries\fR.
.TP
.I "-i"
Request translation between canonical and alternate hostnames. 
.TP
.I "-F filename"
Read genders information from \fIfilename\fR instead of the system
default genders file. If \fIfilename\fR doesn't specify an absolute
path then it is taken to be relative to the directory specified by the
\fIPDSH_GENDERS_DIR\fB environment variable (/etc by default). An
alternate genders file may also be specified via the \fIPDSH_GENDERS_FILE\fR
environment variable.

.SH "nodeupdown module options"
.TP
.I "-v"
Eliminate target nodes that are considered "down" by libnodeupdown.

.SH "slurm module options"
The \fBslurm\fI module allows \fBpdsh\fR to target nodes based on 
currently running SLURM jobs. The \fBslurm\fR module is typically
called after all other node selection options have been processed, 
and if no nodes have been selected, the module will attempt to
read a running jobid from the SLURM_JOBID environment variable 
(which is set when running under a SLURM allocation). If SLURM_JOBID
references an invalid job, it will be silently ignored.
.TP
.I "-j jobid[,jobid,...]"
Target list of nodes allocated to the SLURM job \fIjobid\fR. This option
may be used multiple times to target multiple SLURM jobs. The special
argument "all" can be used to target all nodes running SLURM jobs, e.g.
\fI-j all\fR.

.SH "torque module options"
The \fBtorque\fI module allows \fBpdsh\fR to target nodes based on
currently running Torque/PBS jobs. Similar to the slurm module, the
\fBtorque\fR module is typically called after all other node
selection options have been processed, and if no nodes have been
selected, the module will attempt to read a running jobid from
the PBS_JOBID environment variable (which is set when running under
a Torque allocation).
.TP
.I "-j jobid[,jobid,...]"
Target list of nodes allocated to the Torque job \fIjobid\fR. This option
may be used multiple times to target multiple Torque jobs.

.SH "rms module options"
The \fBrms\fR module allows pdsh to target nodes based on an RMS 
resource. The \fBrms\fR module is typically called after all other
node selection options, and if no nodes have been selected, the 
module will examine the RMS_RESOURCEID environment variable and
attempt to set the target list of hosts to the nodes in the 
RMS resource. If an invalid resource is denoted, the variable is
silently ignored.

.SH "SDR module options"
The SDR module supports targeting hosts via the System Data Repository
on IBM SPs.
.TP
.I "-a"
Target all nodes in the SDR. The list is generated from the 
"reliable hostname" in the SDR by default.
.TP
.I "-i"
Translate hostnames between reliable and initial in the SDR, when applicable. 
If the a target hostname matches either the initial or reliable hostname
in the SDR, the alternate name will be substitued. Thus a list composed
of initial hostnames will instead be replaced with a list of reliable hostnames.
For example, when used with \fI-a\fR above, all initial hostnames in 
the SDR are targeted.
.TP
.I "-v"
Do not target nodes that are marked as not responding in the SDR on
the targeted interface. (If a hostname does not appear in the SDR, then
that name will remain in the target hostlist.)
.TP
.I "-G"
In combination with \fI-a\fR, include all partitions.

.SH "nodeattr module options"
The \fBnodeattr\fR module supports access to the genders database
via the nodeattr(1) command. See the \fBgenders\fR section above
for a list of support options with this module. The option usage
with the \fBnodeattr\fR module is the same as \fBgenders\fR, above,
with the exception that the \fI-i\fR option may only be used
with \fI-a\fR or \fI-g\fR. \fBNOTE\fR: This module will only
work with very old releases of genders where the \fBnodeattr\fR(1)
command supports the \fI-r\fR option, and before the libgenders
API was available. Users running newer versions of genders
will need to use the \fBgenders\fR module instead.

.SH "dshgroup module options"
The dshgroup module allows pdsh to use dsh (or Dancer's shell) style
group files from /etc/dsh/group/ or ~/.dsh/group/. 
.TP
.I "-g groupname,..."
Target nodes in dsh group file "groupname" found in either 
~/.dsh/group/groupname or /etc/dsh/group/groupname.
.TP
.I "-X groupname,..."
Exclude nodes in dsh group file "groupname."

.SH "netgroup module options"
The netgroup module allows pdsh to use standard netgroup entries to
build lists of target hosts. (/etc/netgroup or NIS)
.TP
.I "-g groupname,..."
Target nodes in netgroup "groupname." 
.TP
.I "-X groupname,..."
Exclude nodes in netgroup "groupname."

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
.TP 
PDSH_RCMD_TYPE
Equivalent to the \fI-R\fR option, the value of this environment 
variable will be used to set the default rcmd module for pdsh to
use (e.g. ssh, rsh).
.TP
PDSH_SSH_ARGS
Override the standard arguments that \fBpdsh\fR passes to the
ssh(1) command ("-2 -a -x"). 
.TP
PDSH_SSH_ARGS_APPEND
Append additional options to the ssh(1) command invoked by \fBpdsh\fR.
For example, PDSH_SSH_ARGS_APPEND="-q" would run ssh in quiet mode,
or "-v" would increase the verbosity of ssh.
.TP
WCOLL
If no other node selection option is used, the WCOLL environment
variable may be set to a filename from which a list of target
hosts will be read. The file should contain a list of hosts,
one per line (though each line may contain a hostlist expression.
See \fIHOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS\fR section below).
.TP
DSHPATH
If set, the path in DSHPATH will be used as the PATH for the
remote processes.
.TP
FANOUT
Set the \fBpdsh\fR fanout (See description of \fI-f\fR above).

.SH "HOSTLIST EXPRESSIONS"
As noted in sections above \fBpdsh\fR accepts lists of hosts the general
form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n < m and l < k, etc., as an alternative
to explicit lists of hosts. This form should not be confused with regular
expression character classes (also denoted by ``[]''). For example, foo[19]
does not represent an expression matching foo1 or foo9, but rather 
represents the degenerate hostlist: foo19.

The hostlist syntax is meant only as a convenience on clusters with a 
"prefixNNN" naming convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- this foo1,foo9 could be specified as such, or
by the hostlist foo[1,9].

Some examples of usage follow:

.nf

Run command on foo01,foo02,...,foo05
    pdsh -w foo[01-05] command

Run command on foo7,foo9,foo10
	pdsh -w foo[7,9-10] command

Run command on foo0,foo4,foo5
	pdsh -w foo[0-5] -x foo[1-3] command

.fi

A suffix on the hostname is also supported:

.nf

Run command on foo0-eth0,foo1-eth0,foo2-eth0,foo3-eth0
   pdsh -w foo[0-3]-eth0 command

.fi

As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ('['
and ']') for pattern matching.  Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.  For example, in
tcsh, the first example above should be executed as:

	pdsh -w "foo[01-05]" command

.SH "ORIGIN"
Originally a rewrite of IBM dsh(1) by Jim Garlick <garlick@llnl.gov>
on LLNL's ASCI Blue-Pacific IBM SP system. It is now used on Linux clusters
at LLNL.

.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.LP
When using \fBssh\fR for remote execution, expect the stderr of ssh to be
folded in with that of the remote command. When invoked by \fBpdsh\fR, it
is not possible for \fBssh\fR to prompt for passwords if RSA/DSA keys
are configured properly, etc..  For \fBssh\fR implementations that suppport
a connect timeout option, \fBpdsh\fR attempts to use that option to
enforce the timeout (e.g. -oConnectTimeout=T for OpenSSH), otherwise
connect timeouts are not supported when using \fBssh\fR.  Finally, there 
is no reliable way for \fBpdsh\fR to ensure that remote commands are 
actually terminated when using a command timeout. Thus if \fI-u\fR is 
used with \fBssh\fR commands may be left running on remote hosts even 
after timeout has killed local \fBssh\fR processes.

Output from multiple processes per node may be interspersed when using qshell
or mqshell rcmd modules.

The number of nodes that \fBpdsh\fR can simultaneously execute remote
jobs on is limited by the maximum number of threads that can be created
concurrently, as well as the availability of reserved ports in the rsh 
and qshell rcmd modules. On systems that implement Posix threads, the limit
is typically defined by the constant PTHREADS_THREADS_MAX.
