Pdsh Tests
----------

This directory contains many basic test scripts for pdsh
and its modules. The test framework is borrowed from the
core Git testsuite, and thus shares many of the Git
test features, including output in the Test Anything
Protocol (TAP, testanything.org) format.

Running Tests
-------------

Tests may be run in 3 different ways, the easiest of which
is by issuing "make check" from this directory or the top
level pdsh build directory. The tests may also all be
invoked via ./runtests.sh. Finally, since the tests output
TAP, the tests may be run with any TAP harness, most
notably the prove(1) command, e.g.

 prove --timer -j 4 t[0-9]*.sh
 [15:47:54] t0002-internal.sh ........ ok       79 ms
 [15:47:54] t0101-dshgroup.sh ........ ok      263 ms
 [15:47:54] t1000-dshbak.sh .......... ok      365 ms
 [15:47:54] t0004-module-loading.sh .. ok      329 ms
 [15:47:54] t0003-wcoll.sh ........... ok      569 ms
 [15:47:54] t0001-basic.sh ........... ok      676 ms
 [15:47:54]
 All tests successful.
 Files=8, Tests=55,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.13 usr  0.05 sys +  0.75 cusr  1.64 csys =  2.57 CPU)
 Result: PASS


Test scripts may be run individually as well, e.g.

  ./t0003-wcoll.sh
  ok 1 - hostname range expansion works
  ok 2 - host range expansion does not strip leading zeros
  ok 3 - host range expansion handles mixed size suffixes
  ...
  ok 11 - WCOLL environment variable works
  ok 12 - ranges can be embedded in wcoll files
  # passed all 12 test(s)
  1..12

Tests also support a standard set of options:

 -v, --verbose       Print commands being run and their output
 -d, --debug         Enable any test debugging
 -i, --immediate     Fail immediately on first failed test
 -l, --long-tests    Run additional long-running tests
     --tee           Also write test output to test-results/$TEST_NAME.out
	 --root=dir      Create 'trash' directories under "dir"

Skipping Tests
--------------

The environment variable PDSH_SKIP_TESTS is a space separated list
of patterns that tells which tests to skip, and can either match
the test number t[0-9]{4} to skip an entire test script, or
have an appended .$number to skip a particular test in a test script.

Test Naming
-------------

The test files are by convention named

    tNNNN-<name>.sh

where N is a decimal digit. For pdsh, only the first digit has meaning,
where so far the only digits used are:

   0 - basic pdsh functionality tests
   1 - pdsh module tests
   5 - other tools tests (e.g. dshbak)

Obviously, tests are run in numerical order, so if one test depends on
another it should be numbered higher.
